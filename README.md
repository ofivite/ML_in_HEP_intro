# Introduction to ML for High Energy Physics


## **UPDATE:** this course has been upgraded! Please, have a look at its new version [here](https://github.com/ml-lpi/ml-lpi)




Lecture course given at Lebedev Physical Institute for 3rd year MIPT students in the spring semester 2019.

**Synopsis:**
1.  Supervised/Unsupervised/RL, linear models, trees, metrics, overfitting, regularization, validation
2.  Ensembles (Random Forest, BDT), Neural Networks, CNN, RNN
3.  Modern applications in HEP


**Gateway to an ML world (to name a few):**

<ins>NB</ins>: the links are as of 2019 year, many things have changed since then! Also, some of the courses are in Russian, and the list is definitely not a comprehensive overview of an ML world - there is more out there;)

* [HEP Community White Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02876) - status overview of ML in HEP: what should be done, why and how

* [IML @LHC](https://iml.web.cern.ch) - community of data scientists at LHC. They do open meeting each month!

* [IML github](https://github.com/iml-wg) - and their git page with plenty of useful links on ML and its applications in HEP

* [Summer School on ML in HEP](https://indico.cern.ch/event/768915/)

* [ML in HEP on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hadron-collider-machine-learning#%20) HSE Lambda's course on ML applications in HEP

* [MIPTxYandex specialisation on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis) - A must for beginners (imho). Free certificate for MIPT students (just send an email to mooc@phystech.edu), free enrollment for everyone

* [ML @HSE](https://github.com/esokolov/ml-course-hse) - ML course at HSE  with very simple and intuitive flow

* [ML @MIPT](https://ml-mipt.github.io/) - ML course for DS students @MIPT, very thorough, fundamental and yet detailed

* [Data Mining in Action](https://github.com/data-mining-in-action/) - ML course by Viktor Kantor and co. Amazing and highly recommended - just pick the track you like

* [DL course in Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL) - if you feel like you know the basics and want to go deeper
 
* [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/) - or go deeper in general

* [Deep Learning course book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - a very broad and detailed explaination of DL

* [Interpretable ML](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) a neat summary book of how one can interpret ML models

* [LINKS](https://github.com/demidovakatya/vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie) - lots of them!

* [CNN from Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) - probably a must on NN and CNN basics

* [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) - more on DL

* [articles on Medium](https://medium.com/topic/machine-learning) - but beware, there are at times not that good ones

* links in the slides from this repo

* and way more on the Internet (just google it in English)
