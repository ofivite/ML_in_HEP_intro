# Introduction to ML for HEP


Lecture course given @LPI for 3rd year MIPT students in the spring semester 2019.

**Synopsis:**
1.  Supervised/Unsupervised/RL, linear models, trees, metrics, overfitting, regularization, CV
2.  Ensembles (Random Forest, BDT), Neural Networks, CNN, RNN
3.  Modern applications in HEP


**Gateway to an ML world (to name a few):**

* [HEP Community White Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02876) - status overview of ML in HEP: what should be done, why and how

* [IML @LHC](https://iml.web.cern.ch) - community of data scientists at LHC. They do open meeting each month!

* [Summer School on ML in HEP by HSExYandex](https://indico.cern.ch/event/687473/)

* [MIPTxYandex specialisation on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis) - A MUST. Free certificate for MIPT students (just send an email to mooc@phystech.edu), free enrollment for everyone

* [Data Mining in Action](https://vk.com/data_mining_in_action) - ML for those who never heard of it before. They've just started this semester classes so follow their github for lecture notes, seminars and even homeworks - it's all very fundamental and detailed. Highly recommended.

* [Deep Learning course book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - a really nice one on ML and DL (and it's free!)

* [DL course for HSE students](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL) - links, tutorials, lectures on neural networks - it's all there starting from basics
 
* [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/ - or more generally

* [LOTS OF LINKS](https://github.com/demidovakatya/vvedenie-mashinnoe-obuchenie) - actually I could've put here just this one

* [CNN from Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) - a NN basics easily explained

* and way more in the Internet (just google it in English)
